Project Description
We are looking at a sample of broadly diversified mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that have varying levels of correlation to a conservative bond-stock asset allocation.  We seek to understand the characteristics of these funds through our Exploratory Data Analysis, their correlations with one another, which probability distributions may be the best fit, an examination of one or more portfolio constructions methods using optimization (Risk Parity, Minimum Variance, and Maximum Diversification), and recommendations for further development.
